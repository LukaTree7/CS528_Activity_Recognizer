# CS528_Activity_Recognizer
Before running the project, make sure you have the file "local.properties" under the project_3 folder.

Inside it, there should be 2 lines of code:

* sdk.dir=xxx\\Android\\Sdk

* MAPS_API_KEY=xxx

Replace the "sdk.dir" with ur local android sdk path.

If you wanna test geoFence, just de-comment the home-part codes commented, and replace the home LonLat with ur home's.
